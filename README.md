# GalaxyPopulator
A galaxy population tool for the Advanced Rocketry mod for Minecraft

To generate a galaxy for just one world, place the python files in your \<minecraft folder\>/saves/\<world\>/advRocketry/ folder or if generating for all new worlds, place in your \<minecraft folder\>/config/advRocketry/ folder and run galaxyPopulator.py with no parameters. The populator will use starData.py and config.py for setting up the procedural generation.
