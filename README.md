# GalaxyPopulator
A galaxy population tool for the Advanced Rocketry mod for Minecraft

To generate a galaxy for just one world, place the python files in your \<minecraft folder\>/saves/\<world\>/advRocketry/ folder or if generating for all new worlds, place in your \<minecraft folder\>/config/advRocketry/ folder and run galaxyPopulator.py with no parameters for the default settings or use advanced settings as follows:

"python galaxyPopulator.py <# of stars> <min star size(0.25-1.0 recommended)> <max star size(1.0-2.5 recommended)> <min star temp(50-100 recommended)> <max star temp(100-200 recommended)> <min planets/star(0-1 recommended)> <max planets/star(1-2 recommended)> <min gas giants/ star (0 recommended)> <max gas giants/star (1 recommended)> <% of black holes (1 recommended)>"
